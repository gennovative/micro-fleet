# Database ORM

Micro Fleet has prebuilt package `@micro-fleet/persistence` providing functionalities to work with database. As default, this package uses [ObjectionJS](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) as its object-relation mapping (ORM) library. But you also can create your own data access layer for your needs.
